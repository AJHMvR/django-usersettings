To install this module, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Using pip, downloading and installing is as simple as:

    pip install django-usersettings

Alternatively, just copy or link the usersettings subdirectory somewhere
on your python path.

Requirements for this are:
    * Python, version 2.5 or later;
      note that python3k is still untested and probably won't work
    * Django 1.2 or later.

You're good to go!
